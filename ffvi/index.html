        <p>
            The sixth entry in the Final Fantasy series was dubbed Final Fantasy III in the West because three out of
            the five previous installments of the series had not been released there at the time. Similarly to its
            predecessors, this is a role-playing game where the player controls a party of characters, travelling
            between various locales in the world, fighting randomly appearing regular enemies and bosses, and making the
            characters stronger by improving their skills and getting better equipment for them. The game maintains the
            ATB (active time battle) system of the two previous installments in the series, spicing traditional
            turn-based combat engine with a real-time element.
